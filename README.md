### Content
This repository contains descriptions of the most widely used data science-related concepts accompanied by sample codes made with Python.<br>
The learning notes were created by me while taking introductory "Data Science with Python" courses.<br>
These notes can be helpful to get started with Python while familiarizing yourself with data scientific and statistical concepts.<br>
You can find one common roadmap for mastering Python with this link -> file:///Users/julietamatevosyan/Downloads/Roadmap_to_Python_Mastery.svg
